# Text Normalizer addon for NVDA

[Home page of the addon](https://github.com/alekssamos/textnormalizer_for_nvda/)

Attention! This addon is intended exclusively for the Russian-speaking audience!

### Keyboard shortcuts
There are not enough free combinations now, and they can already be used in other add-ons.

I know that it's better for less advanced users to have them right away, but no. I didn't come up with convenient free gestures.

For this: NVDA Menu, Preferences, Input Gestures, Text Normalizer
* Switches the automatic normalization function - the most important: allows you to quickly turn on and off the real-time conversion;
* Show the settings dialog-Located in the NVDA menu, Tools. Enable copying to the clipboard, whether to change the first letter in a word to a capital one, in order for speech synthesizers to pause in new sentences, as well as test the converter, two text fields, write in one, click on the button, get the corrected text in the second;
* Copy the last text to the clipboard - Said "hеllо wоrld", clicked and copied "hello world";
* Normalize the selected text - Selected one word, clicked, heard a readable version;
* Normalize the last spoken phrase - NVDA just said something, clicked, heard a readable version;
* Normalize the text from the clipboard - you already have the copied text, after clicking it will be replaced with the corrected one.
* Normalize the text under the navigator object - from the numeric keypad or from under the mouse cursor, for example, NVDA takes the text under the navigator and converts it.
### Examples:
> Listen first without the addon, then with it.
